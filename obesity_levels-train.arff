% 4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
% 	This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, 
% 	based on their eating habits and physical condition. this is a random subset of teh original data that contains 17 attributes and 1054 records, the records are labeled with the class 
% 	variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I,
% 	Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III. 77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the
% 	SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.
