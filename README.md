Data Analysis Projects with WEKA
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This collection showcases various data analysis projects conducted using WEKA, a robust tool for data mining that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for applying a wide range of machine learning algorithms. WEKA supports tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.
Project Overview
Datasets and Files
Blood Cells Analysis
•	Files: blood_cells.arff, blood_cells_IMAGEFILTERS_HEALTH_ASSIGNMENT.arff
•	Description: This project involves analyzing blood cell datasets to derive health-related insights. Techniques such as k-means clustering and other machine learning methods were applied to detect patterns and enhance the understanding of medical data.
Heart Failure Clinical Records
•	File: heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset_Final.arff
•	Description: This analysis focuses on clinical records related to heart failure. WEKA’s algorithms were utilized to identify key factors affecting patient health and to improve predictive accuracy.
Medical Reports Analysis
